1. spring.kafka.consumer.bootstrap-servers -->is a configuration property in the Spring for Apache
Kafka (Spring Kafka) library that specifies the address of the Kafka brokers that the Kafka consumer
should connect to.


2.spring.kafka.consumer.group-id is a required property that specifies the consumer group that the Kafka
consumer belongs to. A consumer group is a logical grouping of Kafka consumers that jointly consume a single topic.

spring.kafka.consumer.auto-offset-reset is a configuration property that specifies
what happens when a Kafka consumer starts consuming a topic for the first time or when i
t has no valid offset information for a partition. In such cases, the consumer needs to know
where to begin consuming from.

In the example, earliest is the value assigned to the spring.kafka.consumer.auto-offset-reset property.
 This means that the Kafka consumer will start consuming messages from the earliest available offset
 for the partitions it is assigned to. This ensures that the consumer receives all messages in the topic,
 including those that were produced before the consumer was started.

Overall, these two configuration properties are important for configuring the behavior of
Kafka consumers in a Spring Boot application.


3. spring.kafka.consumer.key-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
spring.kafka.consumer.value-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer

It is assigned to both spring.kafka.consumer.key-deserializer and spring.kafka.consumer.value-deserializer.
This means that the deserializers used by the Kafka consumer expect the key and value to be encoded as strings.
When the consumer receives a message, it will deserialize the key and value byte arrays into Java strings.


4.spring.kafka.producer.key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
  spring.kafka.producer.value-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer

org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer is assigned to both spring.kafka.producer.key-serializer
 and spring.kafka.producer.value-serializer. This means that the serializers used by the Kafka
  producer expect the key and value to be strings. When the producer sends a message,
   it will serialize the key and value strings into byte arrays.


Kafka consumers use the concept of offsets to keep track of their progress in consuming messages
from a topic. The offset is stored by the consumer and used to resume reading from where it left off
after a restart or failure. This ensures that the consumer does not miss any messages while it was
offline and provides fault tolerance.
