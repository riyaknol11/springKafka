In this case, the KafkaTemplate instance is configured to use String as the key serializer
and User as the value serializer. This means that when a message is sent to Kafka using this template,
 the key will be serialized as a String object, and the value will be serialized as a User object.


*Serialization* --> The serialized format typically consists of a sequence of bytes
 that represent the state of the object or data structure.


The serialization process involves converting the Java objects into a byte stream that can be
transmitted over the network and stored in Kafka. Spring Kafka provides several built-in serializers
and deserializers for common data types such as String, Integer, Long, JSON, and Avro, as well as
support for custom serializers and deserializers.

By using a KafkaTemplate with a specific key and value serializer, you can ensure that the
 messages sent to Kafka are properly formatted and compatible with the Kafka consumers that are
  configured to read them.
