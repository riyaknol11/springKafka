1. Partition key -->
Yes, that's correct. In Kafka, producers can choose to specify a partition key while
 publishing messages to a topic. The partition key is a value that is associated with
  the message and is used to determine the partition to which the message should be sent.
   Kafka uses a hashing algorithm on the partition key to determine the partition number,
    which ensures that messages with the same key are always sent to the same partition.
     This helps to ensure that messages are ordered within a partition and that related messages
      are stored in the same partition.

As you mentioned, commonly used partition keys include unique device IDs or user IDs,
 which can help to ensure that messages from the same device or user are sent to the same
  partition, making it easier to process messages that are related to a specific device or user.
